# Jarvis CD

Jarvis CD is a lightweight Build Server/Continuous Delivery tool for the pedantic idealist. It's going to be:

* Really easy to set up
* Embracing pipelines-as-code
* Run as a Git pre-receive hook
* Using Pre-Tested Commits by default
* Be secure by default
* Built on Docker. Pipelines run isolated by default.

This is a work in progress and not intended for production use.
