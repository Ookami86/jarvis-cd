# Jarvis CD

Jarvis CD is a Continuous Delivery tool for the pedantic idealist. The core design philosophies include:

* Trivially easy to set up
* Everything is kept in version control, even the Jarvis Executable
* No Web GUI, only Chat interactions
* Pre-Tested/Gated Commits as a default
* Secure by default
